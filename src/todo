TOP PRIORITY
	
		haiku guidelines warning

		* "fix gaps in indentation when opening"
		* "remove trailing whitespace when saving"

		layer should save docs in tab order, not document order
		(switch pointers in DocList when moving tabs)

		running "replace all" while find pane up needlessly clears results

		ev->filename() - make it a function, using BDirectory
		and add ev->SetFilename()

		context menu
			"Add selection as identifier"
			"Add selection as system constant"
		
		a third color for "true" and "false"
		ordering for colors in menu
		it borks if you delete the project which is currently active

		better FL separators

		text drag n' drop
	
		brace match fails when one but not other is PP'd

	:: R3 todo

		turn off closing of find all when F3

		option to use native-style tabs

		replace doesn't adjust X scroll

		fix number/lexer glitch

		ssbuild
		continuous compilation

		haiku-style grabby

		change functionlist to a BOutlineListView

		build-script -> project dir

		fix "cd" problem with spaces

		check for proper PostMessage usage: caller retains ownership of message. Do an "electric fence" type test.

		add option to settings panel to configure "NPProjectDir".

		do node monitoring for directory deletion, and detect when other
		programs change open files.

		when switching projects, unsaved changes are not saved

		fix lack of hoz scroll bar on compile pane

		replicant support:
			side panel on right is now a replicant tray
			Function List is a replicant that slots into the tray
			also available is a Project Maanger
			an additional tray can be opened on left as well

====================================

	separate shelfs for each replicant, with a resizer grabby between each

	when a replicant is added to a shelf, it is checked whether it is a "Sisong-aware" replicant, or just a regular replicant like the clock

	if replicant is Sisong aware, it is resized to take up the whole shelf, and the shelf is then marked as not accepting any more drags until that replicant is removed.

	there are "add another shelf" and "remove this shelf" context menu items.
=====================================

		fix red line in spacer when changing color schemes 
		
		scroll wheel should work if mouse is over popup pane

		Open Recent

		handle slight-click on spacer
		
		intelligent matching of "break" to "case/default"

		a status box when running Find in Files that shows which file
		is currently being scanned and has a "stop" button like Tracker.

		fix floating app feel of settings panel

		----
		
		disable "smal" stuff for release

		option to auto-convert space indents to tab indents

		auto-compile in background

		mouse gestures
		
		redo search-result pane etc to change the target of the
		message so that we don't have to route through MainWindow

		right-click in Build window to minimize it to bottomness
		so that only the resizer bar is visible. it closes when
		compile is done, or it pops open if an error occurs.
		
		make the cmdseq be owned by the preview panel, not the
		current editview, and cancel when mouse is moved or tab
		is changed.

		search for memory leaks
		
		fix F3 after switching documents		
		
		when spaces selected, Find Box borks		
	
		fix "pinning" when changing size of edit pane
		and build win is up: pin to bottom if already at bottom		
	

ok:
	* - kill of child process fails, because it is actually
		"sh" that gets killed, not the real child.
			^ kill child's children, too?
	* - thread fails to add the line about killing the child PID,
		because the looper is locked by the other thread.
			^ use LockingThread, check if we are holding it
	
	A - Show hoz scrollbar when necessary on compile pane
	B - add "!" as prefix to ignore exit code
	C - fixup finding temp directory dynamically etc
	D - Popups should be in charge of there own title
	

Show Console menu item


Font().TruncateString (for popup pane title)

tab-bar shortcut for "open file in same folder"

	: MainWindow->popup.pane->Open();"TestPane"
	select );" from right to left, and delete. "TestPane" turns bold.

indent on
	for(;;)
	{adfasdf

tabs at start of line cause false negative in Function List

set default dir used by "..." button in find in file dialog

fix "pinning" (with an "extra" "empty" line at the bottom)

whitespace-trimming feature

fix "new 6".

when replacing number in this:
	ev->scroll_down(2)
	by backspacing over the "2",
	lexer does not color properly

text in search results pane should be lexed

pass PP state from one line to another via "\"

switch all edit.Data... structs into classes so we can use
destructors for them, and get rid of the "not C++ way" warning

should be able to push ALT by itself to trigger cmd_seq
after triggering an action, show the name of the action for a moment
in the window.

popup when a file is modified by another program

show commented-out functions as a different color in Function List

brace matching doesn't work within PP-colored lines

numbers aren't colored as a number if they are last char on line

bitmapped font


MEDIUM PRIORITY

option to turn nested comments on off



LOW PRIORITY
[things which could be feasibly fixed using
 the editor itself]

cursor erasure is SERIOUSLY a hack

lexer: more identifier colors for things like "false",
		"B_ALIGN_RIGHT", BButton.

the ClearBelow when we delete a line with less than
a full page visible could be a ClearRegion that clears
just that line.

C++ify line.cpp

include option for calling fsync() after saving
show length of undo buffer
remember position within files even after closing
bitmap font mode so we can have DOSLike back
smart indentation
fix scroll bars
add status bar to left of scrollbar
bold {/}
option to switch CTRL and ALT
create a brace set: (). use DEL to kill the ); '(' does not update to be broken.
BraceScan was supposed to use a static if: it is inefficient to make it a regular function.
proper mouse tracking
objects created via new etc cannot be smal-checked
use native min/max
eliminate "EditView *ev = this"
FunctionList: different FL's or FL sets for each open document soB_INSTRUCTION_ACCESS_EXCEPTION
